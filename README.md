# GBL Notebook Parser

This is a companion project to [GBL Notebook](https://github.com/sambaneko/gbl-notebook); it retrieves, parses and formats Pokemon Go game data files from the PokeMiners' repos.

The formatted files will be updated in the GBL Notebook repo, so you don't need to run this to keep up to date.  If you do want to run it, simply clone and run `parse.php`.  The resulting output files will be populated in the `game-data` directory, which should then be copied into the `game-data` directory of your GBL Notebook instance.
